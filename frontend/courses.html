                            Most of our beginner-level courses require no prior tech
                            experience. We designed them to be friendly to absolute
                            beginners, guiding you through foundational concepts
                            step-by-step. However, intermediate and advanced tracks may
                            require basic familiarity with tools like HTML, Git, or general
                            computer usage. For each course, you'll find a clear outline of
                            prerequisites to help you choose the right level.

                            intensity. Short courses typically last 6 to 8 weeks, perfect
                            for focused skill development. Full tracks or diplomas can range
                            from 3 to 12 months and are designed to help you transition into
                            the tech industry or upskill significantly. All courses are
                            structured to be flexible, allowing you to learn at your own
                            pace with both live and recorded sessions.

                            if live sessions don't work for you. Whether you’re a full-time
                            student or working professional, you can learn comfortably on
                            your schedule.
